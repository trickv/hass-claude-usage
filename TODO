# TODO

- Work on the onboarding screen bugs
- Can the integration info view show my anthropic account name? so if i have two accounts logged in / two instances of the integration. Will require exploration of api.
- Put screenshots in README to explain what this is.
- Make an icon!
- figure out if anthropic is sending any decimal places after % else set sensor precisions to no decimal places
