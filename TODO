# TODO

- figure out if anthropic is sending any decimal places after % else set sensor precisions to no decimal places
- Can we bundle a dashboard?
- Add repository topics to fix HACS validation warning (e.g., home-assistant, hacs, integration, claude, anthropic)
- Optional: Submit to Home Assistant brands repo (https://github.com/home-assistant/brands)
